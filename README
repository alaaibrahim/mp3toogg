Problem:
I need to convert a bunch of files from mp3 to ogg while keeping the id3tags

This script does that, but I think it might need some modifications. It's working fine with me, hope it would be helpful, and any input is appreciated.

This might be my first ruby script, so don't bash me if you don't like the code :-)

in order to work, this script needs mplayer, oggenc, and id3tool.
